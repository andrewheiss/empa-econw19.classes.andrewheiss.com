# Paper airplanes and diminishing marginal product

Here's the average production function:

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r airplanes-class-avg, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
source(here("lib", "graphics.R"))

planes_class <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "planes_class.csv")) %>%
  mutate(Round = paste("Round", Round))

planes_by_round <- planes_class %>%
  group_by(Workers) %>%
  summarize(Airplanes = mean(Airplanes))

ggplot(planes_by_round, aes(x = Workers, y = Airplanes)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "grey60") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), 
              se = FALSE, color = nord_dk_blue, size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 12), ylim = c(0, 20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, 2)) +
  labs(x = "Number of workers per firm", y = "Average number of airplanes",
       title = "Average number of airplanes produced by 5 firms",
       subtitle = "Four rounds played",
       caption = "MPA 612, Winter 2019\nRomney Institute of Public Management\nBrigham Young University") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

</figure>

And here's the by-round production function (yay learning!):

<figure class="fullwidth">

```{r airplanes-class-by-round, echo=FALSE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
ggplot(planes_class, aes(x = Workers, y = Airplanes, color = Round)) + 
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(planes_class, Round %in% c("Round 1", "Round 4")),
              method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), se = FALSE, size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(data = planes_by_round, method = "lm", formula = y ~ log(x), 
              size = 1, color = "grey60", se = FALSE, linetype = "dashed") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1, 12), ylim = c(0, 25)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 12, 2)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_dk_blue, nord_purple, nord_yellow, nord_orange),
                     name = NULL) +
  labs(x = "Number of workers per firm", y = "Number of airplanes produced",
       title = "Number of airplanes produced by 5 firms, by round",
       subtitle = "Four rounds played",
       caption = "MPA 612, Winter 2019\nRomney Institute of Public Management\nBrigham Young University") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/QfoTI9cFmwofixLD2) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
