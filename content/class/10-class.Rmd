# The Paper River

This simulation is an adaptation of "The Paper River,"[@HoytRyanHouston:1999] with some modifications borrowed from [John Whitehead](http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/eco3620/games/paperriver/index.htm).

```{r game-results, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

source(here("lib", "graphics.R"))

results <- read_csv(here("static", "data", "multiplicative-airlines.csv"),
                    col_types = cols(Section = col_character())) %>%
  mutate(Role = recode(Role, A = "Math", B = "Planes"))

# Total earnings
results %>%
  group_by(Round, Role) %>% 
  summarize(Average = mean(Profits)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Round, y = Average, color = Role, group = Role)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_lt_blue, nord_orange), name = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Average profit",
       title = "Average profit for upstream and downstream firms") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

# Costs imposed on downstream firms
results %>% 
  filter(Role == "Planes") %>% 
  group_by(Round) %>% 
  summarize(Costs = mean(Costs)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Round, y = Costs)) +
  geom_line(size = 1.5, color = nord_purple) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(nord_yellow, nord_purple), name = NULL) +
  labs(y = "Average costs for XYZ Airlines", 
       title = "Average costs taken on by downstream firms") +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())
```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
bloop <- results %>% 
  group_by(Role, Person) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(Profits)) %>% 
  mutate(adjusted = total / 5) %>% 
  mutate(points = round(adjusted, 0)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))

# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/QfoTI9cFmwofixLD2) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
