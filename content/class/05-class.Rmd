# International Trade Game

This game was originally developed by the international NGO Action Aid and [adapted by Dr. John Sloman from the University of the West of England](https://www.economicsnetwork.ac.uk/showcase/sloman_game).

## Results

```{r calc-results, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pander)
library(ggstance)
library(here)

source(here("lib", "graphics.R"))

results <- tribble(
  ~team,     ~total,
  "A1",      7700,
  "A2 & B2", 52500,
  "B1",      11800,
  "C1",      12150,
  "C2",      19350,
) %>%
  mutate(team = fct_inorder(team, ordered = TRUE) %>% fct_rev())

results_summary <- results %>%
  rename(`Total earnings` = total) %>%
  mutate(`% of world earnings` = `Total earnings` / sum(`Total earnings`)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  arrange(desc(`% of world earnings`)) %>%
  mutate(total = `Total earnings`)
```

Two countries merged and outperformed all other countries (even if they split their earnings 50/50 at the end, both countries still would have won). 

```{r plot-results, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3.5}
ggplot(results, aes(x = total, y = team)) +
  geom_pointrangeh(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = total), size = 0.75, color = nord_orange) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(x = "Final earnings", y = NULL) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())
```

```{r table-results, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
results_summary %>%
  select(Country = team, everything(), -total) %>%
  mutate(`Total earnings` = scales::dollar(`Total earnings`),
         `% of world earnings` = scales::percent(`% of world earnings`)) %>% 
  pandoc.table()
```

\

This distribution of wealth created a moderately unequal society, with a Gini coefficient of `r results_summary %>% pull(total) %>% ineq::Gini() %>% round(2)`.

```{r plot-gini, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
get_lorenz <- function(x) {
  lorenz_raw <- ineq::Lc(x)
  tibble(prop_population = lorenz_raw$p,
         prop_income = lorenz_raw$L)
}

results_gini <- get_lorenz(results_summary$`Total earnings`)

ggplot(data = results_gini) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(x = prop_population,
                  ymin = prop_income,
                  ymax = prop_population), 
              fill = nord_orange, alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(x = prop_population, y = prop_income), 
            color = nord_orange, size = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, size = 0.5, color = "grey50") +
  labs(x = "Cumulative % of population", y = "Cumulative % of income") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0), labels = scales::percent, breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2)) +
  theme_econ(13) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.25))
```


# Clearest and muddiest things

Go to [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/QfoTI9cFmwofixLD2) and answer these three questions:

1. What was the muddiest thing from class today? What are you still wondering about?
2. What was the clearest thing from class today? 
3. What was the most exciting thing you learned?

I'll compile the questions and send out answers after class.
