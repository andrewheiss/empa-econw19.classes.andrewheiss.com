<h3 id="capitalism">Capitalism</h3>
<p><strong>You should understand…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>…the components of the capitalist economic system: private property, markets, and firms</li>
<li>…what happens when any of these components gets distorted</li>
<li>…what makes public goods different from regular goods (see public goods game)</li>
<li>…what institutions are and how they coordinate action</li>
<li>…what GDP is, what it measures, what it doesn’t measure, what problems there are with it, what alternatives there are for it, and why it continues to be popular</li>
<li>…the difference between real and nominal values (and why we care)</li>
<li>…what a price index is</li>
<li>…what purchasing power parity (PPP) is (and also what the Big Mac Index is)</li>
<li>…the downsides of capitalism (inequality + environmental damage)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Games and simulations played in class:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pit market trading with paper clips</em>: how supply and demand are derived from producer willingness to accept and consumer willingness to pay</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important fomulas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adjusting for inflation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \text{Real} = \frac{\text{Nominal}}{\text{Price Index / 100}}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Percent change:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \frac{\text{Current} - \text{Previous}}{\text{Previous}}
  \]</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compound annual growth rate (CAGR); periodic method (this assumes interest is compounded once a year; this is the harder method and you don’t really need to use it):</p>
<span class="math display">\[
  r = exp(\frac{ln(\frac{\text{Price index}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Price index}_{\text{old}}})}{t}) - 1
  \]</span></li>
<li><p>Compound annual growth rate (CAGR): continuous method (this assumes interest is compounded continuously; this is the easier method and you should generally use this):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  r = \frac{ln(\frac{\text{Price index}_{\text{new}}}{\text{Price index}_{\text{old}}})}{t}
  \]</span></p></li>

<li>…what social dilemmas, collective action problems, and tragedies of the commons are</li>
<li>…the difference between a stag hunt game and a prisoners dilemma game, why that difference is important, and why stag hunts are possibly a better metaphor for social dilemmas</li>

<li>…what a nudge is and how it relates to choice architecture, libertarian paternalism, and public policy and administration</li>
<li>…how incentives can get crowded out and distorted when extrinsic rewards or punishments replace intrinsic motivation (i.e. don’t marketize important social relationships; pay enough or don’t pay at all)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Games and simulations played in class:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Public goods game with black and red cards</em>: free riding, non-rivalry, and non-excludability</li>

<li>Pop quiz 1: Sarah loves to listen to New Age music and faithfully reads her horoscope each day. In her spare time, she enjoys aromatherapy and participating in a local spirituality community.
<ul>
<li>Sarah is likely a holistic healer</li>
<li>Sarah is likely a school teacher (correct answer; insensitivity to prior probability of outcomes + representativeness)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pop quiz 2: Provo is served by two hospitals. In the larger hospital, about 45 babies are born each day, and in the smaller hospital about 15 babies are born each day. As you know, about 50% of all babies are boys, but the exact percentage varies from day to day—sometimes it’s a bit higher than 50%, and sometimes it’s lower. The hospitals make special note of when more than 60% of the babies born that day are boys. Which hospital do you thing recorded more of these boy-heavy days?
<ul>
<li>The smaller hospital (correct answer; insensitivity to sample size)</li>
<li>The larger hospital</li>
<li>About the same</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pop quiz 3:
<ul>
<li>Prompt 1: International NGOs don’t have regular access to regional international organizations. Today, NGOs participate in only 5% of African Union meetings.</li>
<li>Prompt 2: Regional international organizations have become increasingly important. Today, nearly 100% of African countries are part of the African Union.</li>
<li>Question: What percent of North American and European countries are members of NATO (the North American Treaty Organizations)? (example of anchoring)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>True random vs. fake random coin flips (misconception of chance)</li>
</ul>
